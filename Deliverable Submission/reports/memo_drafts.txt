I. Introduction

This memo presents the findings of the analysis conducted on the change in volume and value of claims and theft reimbursements following the policy change implemented on January 27, 2023. The analysis aims to provide insights into the impact of the policy change on the monetary aspects of theft claims and reimbursements. The analysis was conducted using [Specify the data analysis tools or methods used], which are commonly employed by data scientists for similar analyses. Additionally, this memo discusses the assumptions and limitations of the data, including the need for cloud computing due to the large dataset sizes, as well as the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed.

II. Findings

Total Claims
The total value of claims reported before the policy change (pre-policy) was $91,512,819.47, while the total value of claims reported after the policy change (post-policy) was $14,669,931.82.

Average Claim
The average value of claims before the policy change was $303.85, and the average value of claims after the policy change was $330.34.

Distribution of Claims
A histogram of the claim values (adj_amt) grouped into ranges was generated to visualize the distribution of claim values before and after the policy change. The histogram showed changes in the distribution of claim values between the two periods.

Total Reimbursements
The total value of reimbursements reported before the policy change was $48,896,250.00, and the total value of reimbursements reported after the policy change was $25,368,774.00.

Average Reimbursement
The average value of reimbursements before the policy change was $635.68, and the average value of reimbursements after the policy change was $588.66.

Distribution of Reimbursements
A histogram of the reimbursement values (benefit_amount) grouped into ranges was generated to visualize the distribution of reimbursement values before and after the policy change. The histogram showed changes in the distribution of reimbursement values between the two periods.

Time-based Comparison
The count and total amount of claims and reimbursements were compared for the periods before and after the policy change. The results showed differences in the volume and value of claims and reimbursements between the two periods.

Monthly Trend Analysis
Monthly trends in the volume and value of claims and reimbursements were analyzed to identify any significant differences before and after the policy change. The trends showed variations in the volume and value of claims and reimbursements over time, with potential changes after the policy change.

Temporal Patterns
Temporal patterns in the transact_date and pay_date features were analyzed to uncover any seasonality or specific patterns related to high claim volumes or values. These patterns could provide additional context to the changes observed after the policy implementation.

III. Model/Empirical Strategy

The analysis was conducted using [Specify the data analysis tools or methods used], which are commonly employed by data scientists for similar analyses. These tools provide capabilities for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis, allowing for efficient processing and extraction of insights from large datasets. By utilizing [Specify the tools or methods used], the data scientist can handle complex computations, visualize data, and perform statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the data.

IV. Assumptions and Limitations

The analysis assumes that the provided dataset is representative and accurately reflects the claims and reimbursements related to the policy change. However, there are several assumptions and limitations to consider:

Cloud Computing Requirement: Due to the large dataset

From the temporal analysis of claims and reimbursements before and after the policy change, several patterns and insights can be observed.

Claims Temporal Patterns:
Before the policy change, the highest number of claims were observed on the 2nd and 1st of each month, with 39,800 and 32,924 claims respectively. The claim volume gradually decreased throughout the month. After the policy change, the highest number of claims shifted to the 2nd and 1st of each month, with 6,534 and 5,729 claims respectively. The claim volume also decreased throughout the month, but the overall volume was significantly lower compared to before the policy change. This indicates a decrease in the number of claims filed after the policy change.

Reimbursements Temporal Patterns:
Before the policy change, the highest number of reimbursements occurred on the 19th, 15th, and 9th of each month, with 3,493, 3,355, and 3,320 reimbursements respectively. After the policy change, the highest number of reimbursements shifted to the 10th, 16th, and 9th of each month, with 2,363, 2,202, and 2,200 reimbursements respectively. The reimbursement volume decreased after the policy change, but the overall patterns remained similar.

The temporal analysis indicates that both claims and reimbursements showed a decrease in volume after the policy change. However, it's important to note that the analysis is based on a monthly trend, and there may be additional factors influencing the patterns.

Assumptions and Limitations:
The analysis and findings are based on the provided data and assumptions made during the analysis. It is important to consider the following assumptions and limitations:

Data Source: The analysis assumes that the data used is reliable, accurate, and representative of the entire population. Any data quality issues or biases in the dataset could affect the findings.

Policy Change Impact: The findings suggest a decrease in both the volume and value of claims and reimbursements after the policy change. However, other factors could have contributed to these changes, such as changes in reporting behavior, market trends, or external events. It is essential to consider these factors when interpreting the results.

Data Preprocessing: The analysis involved cleaning and preprocessing the datasets, including handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. The effectiveness of these preprocessing steps in addressing the data quality issues and ensuring the accuracy of the results depends on the quality and completeness of the original data.

Temporal Analysis: The temporal analysis focused on monthly trends and patterns. While this provides insights into the general trends, it may not capture short-term or specific day-to-day variations. Other time granularity analysis, such as weekly or daily patterns, could provide additional insights.

Statistical Analysis: The analysis utilized descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to summarize and interpret the data. More advanced statistical methods or predictive modeling could provide further insights and enable more robust analysis.

Conclusion:
The analysis of the claims and reimbursements before and after the policy change indicates a decrease in both the volume and value of claims and reimbursements. The average value of claims and reimbursements also showed a slight increase after the policy change. The temporal patterns suggest a shift in claim and reimbursement activity to different days of the month. However, it is important to consider the limitations and assumptions of the analysis and further investigate other potential factors influencing these changes.
