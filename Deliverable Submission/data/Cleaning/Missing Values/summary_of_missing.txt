========================================================
When deciding whether to impute the mode for rows with missing values or delete the rows with missing values in the claims_copy and reimbursements_copy dataframes, it is important to consider best practices and the specific characteristics of the datasets.

For the claims_copy dataframe with 345,588 rows and a missing value percentage of 72.557127% in the retail_zip feature, it is advisable to analyze the impact of missing values on the analysis goals and the overall context of the project. Here are some considerations:

Geographical Analysis: Since the retail_zip feature represents the zip code of the retailer location where the theft transaction occurred, it allows for geographical breakdown and analysis. Deleting rows with missing values would result in the loss of geographical information, potentially missing important insights. Imputing the mode for rows with missing values in retail_zip would retain the geographical aspect, enabling the analysis of geographical variations in the volume and value of claims and theft reimbursements.

Regional Trends: Analyzing changes in volume and value of claims and theft reimbursements per retail_zip before and after the policy change can reveal regional trends. By deleting rows with missing values, regional patterns may be disrupted, and the analysis could lose the ability to identify significant impacts in specific regions. Imputing the mode for missing values would preserve regional trends and help capture regional variations in the analysis.

Based on these considerations, it is recommended to impute the mode for missing values in the retail_zip feature of the claims_copy dataframe.

For the reimbursements_copy dataframe with 120,020 rows and missing value percentages of 72.651225% in client_language_2, 93.243626% in client_language_3, and 97.978670% in client_language_4, the client_language_X features provide information about the primary spoken languages of the individuals associated with a given case. Here are some considerations:

Demographic Analysis: Deleting rows with missing values in the client_language_X features would result in the loss of information about the primary spoken languages and demographic distribution of the individuals receiving reimbursements. Imputing the mode for missing values would allow the analysis to consider the demographic aspects and understand how different language groups were affected by the policy change.

Communication Effectiveness: Analyzing the impact of the policy change on different language groups requires understanding the primary languages of the beneficiaries. Deleting rows with missing values in client_language_X would hinder the assessment of communication effectiveness. Imputing the mode for missing values would enable the analysis to evaluate the impact of the policy change on different language groups based on primary language data.

Considering these considerations, it is recommended to impute the mode for missing values in the client_language_X features of the reimbursements_copy dataframe.
