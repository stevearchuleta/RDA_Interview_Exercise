MySQL BUSINESS QUESTIONS:

1.TOTAL Claims
adj_amt
Calculate the total value of claims reported before and after the policy change. Sum the adj_amt for transactions before the policy change date ('2023-01-27') and after the policy change date to observe the overall impact of the policy change on the monetary value of theft claims.

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN transact_date < '2023-01-27' THEN adj_amt ELSE 0 END) AS total_claims_pre_policy,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transact_date >= '2023-01-27' THEN adj_amt ELSE 0 END) AS total_claims_post_policy
FROM claims;

TOTAL CLAIMS PRE POLICY: $ 91,512,819.47
TOTAL CLAIMS POST POLICY: $ 14,669,931.82



2.AVERAGE Claim
adj_amt
Calculate the average value of claims by dividing the total adj_amt by the number of claims. Provide insights into whether the policy change affected not only the volume but also the average size of theft claims.

SELECT 
    AVG(CASE WHEN transact_date < '2023-01-27' THEN adj_amt END) AS average_claim_value_pre_policy,
    AVG(CASE WHEN transact_date >= '2023-01-27' THEN adj_amt END) AS average_claim_value_post_policy
FROM claims;

AVERAGE CLAIM VALUE PRE POLICY: $ 303.85
AVERAGE CLAIM VALUE POST POLICY: $ 330.34



3. Distribution of Claims
adj_amt
Generate a histogram of the claim values (adj_amt) grouped into ranges. Categorize the claims into pre-policy and post-policy periods and count the number of claims falling within each value range. The histogram helps visualize any changes in the distribution of claim values after the policy change.Analyze the total value, average value, and distribution of claim values before and after the policy change. Gain insight into the impact of the policy change on the monetary aspects of theft claims.

SELECT 
    CASE WHEN transact_date < '2023-01-27' THEN 'Pre-Policy' ELSE 'Post-Policy' END AS policy_period,
    FLOOR(adj_amt / 100) * 100 AS claim_value_range,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claims
WHERE transact_date < '2023-01-27' OR transact_date >= '2023-01-27' -- Adjust the dates as needed
GROUP BY policy_period, claim_value_range
ORDER BY policy_period, claim_value_range;

-- 233 rows returned



4.TOTAL Reimbursements
benefit_amout
Calculate the total value of reimbursements reported before and after the policy change.Sum the benefit_amount for transactions before the policy change date ('2023-01-27') and after the policy change date to observe the overall impact of the policy change on the monetary value of theft reimbursements.

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN pay_date < '2023-01-27' THEN benefit_amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_reimbursements_pre_policy,
    SUM(CASE WHEN pay_date >= '2023-01-27' THEN benefit_amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_reimbursements_post_policy
FROM reimbursements;
 
TOTAL REIMBURSEMENTS PRE POLICY: $ 48,896,250.00
TOTAL REIMBURSEMENTS POST POLICY: $ 25,368,774.00



5. AVERAGE Reimbursements
benefit amount
Calculate the average value of reimbursements by dividing the total benfit_amount by the number of reimbursements. Provide insights into whether the policy change affected not only the volume but also the average size of theft reimbursements.

SELECT
AVG(benefit_amount) AS average_reimbursement_value
FROM reimbursements;

SELECT
AVG(CASE WHEN pay_date < '2023-01-27' THEN benefit_amount END) AS average_reimbursement_value_pre_policy,
AVG(CASE WHEN pay_date >= '2023-01-27' THEN benefit_amount END) AS average_reimbursement_value_post_policy
FROM reimbursements;


AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT VALUE PRE POLICY: $ 635.68
AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT VALUE POST POLICY: $ 588.66



6.Distribution of Reimbursements
benefit_amount
Generate a histogram of the reimbursement values (benefit_amount) grouped into ranges. Categorize the claims into pre-policy and post-policy periods and count the number of reimbursements falling within each value range. The histogram helps visualize any changes in the distribution of reimbursement values after the policy change. Analyze the total value, average value, and distribution of reimbursement values before and after the policy change. Gain insight into the impact of the policy change on the monetary aspects of theft reimbursements.

SELECT 
    CASE WHEN transact_date < '2023-01-27' THEN 'Pre-Policy' ELSE 'Post-Policy' END AS policy_period,
    FLOOR(adj_amt / 100) * 100 AS claim_value_range,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claims
WHERE transact_date < '2023-01-27' OR transact_date >= '2023-01-27' -- Adjust the dates as needed
GROUP BY policy_period, claim_value_range
ORDER BY policy_period, claim_value_range;

-- 80 rows returned



7. Time-based Comparison
transact_date, pay_date, adj_amt, benefit_amout
Retrieve the count and total amount of claims and theft reimbursements for both the periods before and after the policy change. Combines the results for claims and reimbursements into a single result set (indicating the policy period) and provide the count and total amount for each category.Compare the volume (count) and value (total amount) of claims and reimbursements before and after the policy change.

SELECT
    'Claims - Before Policy Change' AS category,

8. Monthly Trend Analysis
transact_date, pay_date, adj_amt, benefit_amount
Analyze the monthly trends in the volume and value of claims and theft reimbursements over time, and identify any significant differences before and after the policy change. Retrieve the monthly trends for both claims and reimbursements. Calculate the count of claims and reimbursements as well as the total amount for each month. Observe the trends in the volume and value of claims and reimbursements over time. Compare the trends before and after the policy change to identify any significant differences in the patterns.  Results display the monthly claim trends before the policy change, the monthly claim trends after the policy change, and the overall monthly reimbursement trends.
